           <h2>Scene Transitions - 27/04/2023</h2>
<p>Today I set to work on the scene transition from the test area, into the house, and back out to the test area. I’ve done scene transitions before 
  but not for entering/exiting buildings. I created an empty game object in my scene, added box collider 2D, and set it as a trigger. I then 
  positioned the collider over the interior door of the house, in my player script I had already setup the collision detection for the exterior door, 
  so I added a short bit code to this so it could detect if the player had collided with the interior door. Then, in a scene management script I set
  the scene to change back to the test area when the player collides with the interior door. This worked fine but I found the instant scene change to 
  be harsh when playing the game. I had no idea how to delay the scene change so asked ChatGPT for help, it suggested creating a method for each scene
  change and invoking the method with a float parameter for the time delay which worked perfectly! Next, I need to make sure the player is in the 
  correct position once he returns to the test area. Then, I can move onto the dialogue system tutorial.

           <h2>Digispark ATTiny85 Rubber Ducky - 26/04/2023</h2>
   <p> A few days ago, I found my Digispark ATTiny85 microcontroller in the back of one of my desk drawers. I purchased it after visiting a forum 
    discussion on ‘bad USBs’ where one of the posters said you could pick one up on Amazon for around £3! What is it? The Digispark ATTiny85 is a 
    small, exposed board microcontroller with a built-in USB connector meaning it can be programmed directly from a computer. 
    <br><br>
    So, this morning I thought I’d finally get round to making my Rubber Ducky. Following along with a tutorial I installed the Arduino IDE and 
    relevant drivers, found a Wi-Fi password stealer GitHub repo for the code, and used webhook.site for a temporary URL to receive the webhook 
    data (in this case: Wi-Fi password). All-in-all it took around half an hour for the rubber ducky to be complete and functioning flawlessly. 
    Rubber ducky’s are designed to look like regular USBs. However, instead of storing data, they contain a small computer which emulates a keyboard
    when plugged into the target device, the computer assumes all is well as it is used to receiving information from the user via the keyboard. 
    Once plugged in, the malicious script will be executed to access and send the targeted sensitive data to the hacker.  
<br><br>
    Hacking projects mentioned on my blog will never be used maliciously, I test them on my own devices and networks only.

        <h2>Game in Unity - 25/04/2023</h2>
          <p>Quick post with a screenshot of the game in Unity in its current state. Everything is as it was before the scene corruption. I’ll be implementing the dialogue system over the next few days. Then, I’ll be designing the interior of the house and setting up a scene transition so when the player enters the house, the test area disappears, and the house interior is shown.

        <h2>Website Relocation - 25/04/2023</h2>
          <p>
Originally, I hosted a free WordPress site with 000Webhost and I was going to use that for the blog. But once I had the site setup to my liking and 
            had my first two blog posts, I realised I’d already used around 40% of my 300MB available space. Also, Google Chrome was annoyingly 
            flagging the blog page as a potentially dangerous site.  So, I began looking around for free alternatives but, I didn’t really find 
            anything worthwhile. Later that day I happened to be on someone else’s blog reading an ATtiny85 rubber ducky tutorial (which I’ll be 
            starting soon) and wondered how they were hosting their site. I had a look around the site and found they were using GitHub Pages, so 
            I went over to YouTube and searched for a GitHub Pages free website tutorial and began building my page. I downloaded my original site 
            via FTP using filezilla, I thought it would be worth trying to transfer the website files to my new GitHub page. I wasn’t overly 
            optimistic as my original site was using the WordPress content management system and my GitHub Page wasn't - long story short, it 
            didn’t work. So, I started setting up the new page using HTML with ChatGPT there to help when I needed it, and here we are! GitHub 
            Pages has 1GB of available free space which should keep the blog going for a while, if I get close to exceeding that, I can consider 
            my options as to what I'll do next, but for now I’ll be keeping the blog here.

    <h2>Unknown Error - 25/04/2023</h2>
    <p>
So, ironically after I wrote the last post regarding the current state of the game, I opened up Unity to take some screenshots for the blog and was 
      greeted with a red error message stating there was an unknown error while loading my scene! After a quick google and a conversation with 
      ChatGPT I had a few potential fixes to try out in an attempt save many hours of work. I tried: re-importing the scene, deleting scene metadata,
      editing the unity scene file, copying the entire project folder and re-importing... all to no avail. I did have a backup, but it was 9 
      days old, so it wasn't of much use. Needless to say, I'll be far more vigilant with my backups going forward. Fortunately, it was only my 
      scene that was corrupted, and my assets and scripts were still present. So, I set about painting a new test area from the tile palette and 
      configuring my various assets with the correct scripts and settings. I tried to remind myself that though annoying, it was probably a good 
      opportunity to reinforce what I'd learnt, and the game is now back to its previous state.

        <h2>Current State of the Game - 24/04/2023</h2>
        <p>In this post I thought I'd discuss the game in its current state, what I'm working on now, and what's next.
          <br><br>
          Currently the game has a small test area with trees, water, and a house. There is a playable character who is fully animated and can be controlled by the user. There is also a fully animated NPC wizard who patrols the test area randomly and has a single line of dialogue if the user interacts with him. The house has an animated door that opens when the player is in range and the player sprite has a fade animation to make it appear that the player has entered the building. 
          For the input controls I've modified a touch screen thumbstick asset to make it function as a D-Pad on the left side of the screen and I have an action button on the right side of the screen which for now is being used to interact with the NPC and trigger dialogue.
          <br><br>
          At the moment I'm working on implementing a dialogue mechanic into the game. I attempted to do this myself and managed to trigger a dialogue box and text to be displayed when the player interacts with the NPC, but this wouldn't work for multiple lines of dialogue with multiple characters. So, I'm going to be following a far more advanced YouTube tutorial which is more fit for purpose. 
          <br><br>
          As for the future of the game and what I'd like to achieve, I'd like to create a functioning game with a basic storyline, multiple levels, more characters, weapons, and enemies. I think this is a reasonable and achievable goal. As I said in my previous post, this game is personal project to become more proficient at programming and game design, therefore I may decide to leave this project unfinished to move onto something I believe to be more productive.
          <br><br>

          <h2>Hello World! - 23/04/2023</h2>
        <p>In my first post I wanted to outline my intentions with the blog and discuss my current project. 
My aim is to collate my work into an accessible portfolio-style journal that could be presented 
to potential employers and to keep track of my progress for personal development. Prior to starting 
this blog my personal projects have gone undocumented and in some cases forgotten.
<br><br>
For my current project I am developing a 2D top-down RPG game for Android using Unity game engine 
for the game development and Aseprite for the sprite and asset design. I always attempt to write as 
much of the code as I can myself but when I need help I've been using a combination of: YouTube tutorials, 
google, and ChatGPT. I want to be completely forthcoming that the code in the game is an amalgamation of my code, 
tutorials, and ChatGPT. The game is a personal learning project to further my understanding of programming and 
game development and I currently have no intentions of releasing it on the Play Store. 
<br><br>
I hope to upload some screenshots of the game later today and keep the blog updated as often as I can. 
Ideally I'd like to update the blog each time I work on the game, but due to family commitments and uni 
this is near impossible, so I may do a bulk update with multiple posts to keep the blog up-to-date.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading,
<br><br>
