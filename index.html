           <h2>My First Game – 27/05/2023</h2>
<p>Prior to starting my current project, I had experimented with Unity and followed tutorials for 2D and 3D asset development in Blender and Aseprite. During that time, I also designed a small game which I’d like to briefly discuss in this post.
<br><br>I use the term "game" loosely as it was more of a level than a complete game. The goal was to create, animate, and import, some 2D assets from Aseprite into Unity. The level incorporated various game mechanics that I believed would be valuable for me to learn and easily transferrable to future game development projects. Some of mechanics I implemented included player movement, enemy AI, projectiles, a health bar, a health system, a death system, and a game over screen. 
<br><br>Working on this project was a valuable learning experience, and it presented its fair share of challenges. However, I found the time invested to be worthwhile as it provided me with a valuable insight into the process of designing a game—from creating the artwork to coding. Having this project as a reference will be immensely helpful when I implement similar mechanics in future games. I've included a screenshot of the game below.

           <h2>3D Mini Game – 27/05/2023</h2>
<p>
Recently, I’ve been spending such a large amount of time on my main project, and I’m really pleased with how it’s turning out. However, as the game progresses, I feel I’m delving deeper into more advanced areas of game development while neglecting the basics. Therefore, I’ve decided to put the main project on hold for now and design a mini-game in 3D.
<br><br>The basic concept of the game is as follows: the player, temporarily represented by a cube, must jump over the moving beam that increases in speed over time. If the player touches the beam, its game over, and their score is equal to the amount of time they managed to play without colliding with the beam. I intend to create power-ups, and various increases in difficulty such as changes in player size, jump height, multiple and thicker beams, and potentially holes in the ground for the player to avoid.
<br><br>I’m really pleased with how the game is coming along, and its rewarding to see such quick progression in comparison to my other project. I’ve been able to code a significant portion of the game myself, and I’ve been taking detailed notes on player movement which will be valuable for future projects. I’ve attached below a screenshot of the game in its current state, and another showing the game over screen.

           <h2>Door Entry/Exit – 23/05/2023</h2>
<p>I’ve just finished working on the door entry/exit system. Previously, I had created a scene management system and intended on changing the scene when entering the house and returning to the previous scene when the player exited the house. After a bit of Googling, I decided to scrap that idea and stick to one scene, by having the interior of the house located at a different position within the same scene. This way, I could teleport the player into the building using the sprites transform position and do the same on their way out. I created two methods: one for the house entry and the other for the house exit. Within these methods, I used if statements to check which collider the player had made contact with, and then used the relevant coordinates to teleport the player to the correct position. I invoked a delay for the teleportation to allow the door animation to finish before the player entered, providing a smoother transition between each entry/exit.

           <h2>Game Update – 21/05/2023</h2>
<p>Lately, I haven’t been able to spend as much time on the game as I would like, but I’ve been doing what I can with what little time I have. Mostly, this has been spent polishing the fishing mechanics. Realistically, fishing was unnecessary, and I could have spent that time developing the core game mechanics and made greater progression overall with the game. This in some ways is a lesson learnt with regards to prioritising different aspects of the game, but I’ve learnt a lot whilst creating the fishing mechanic, so I don’t see this as wasted time, just something to take into consideration going forward.
  <br><br>
My next job is editing the player movement script. The tutorial I followed for my player movement used the player transform to move the sprite, this is causing issues with collisions and physics, which is not something I was aware of when I started making the game. I’m hoping this will be a fairly simple process of changing over from transform to rigidbody so I can move onto the door entry/exit system, then it will be time to think about some dialogue and level design!

           <h2>ESP8266 Beacon Spammer – 21/05/2023</h2>
<p>Yesterday I followed a tutorial to create a beacon spammer using a ESP8266 microcontroller. Once the device is set up, it runs a beacon spamming script that allows the device to create a set number of fake available Wi-Fi networks. Hackers may use this approach with the intention of tricking a user to connect to the fake network, once connected, the attacker may launch further attacks such as intercepting traffic or stealing sensitive information. For me it was just a cheap mini project and a party trick! I’ll be trying out some more hacks using the ESP8266 that will utilize the mini-OLED sometime soon.

           <h2>Update - 12/05/2023</h2>
<p>I haven’t had a chance to update the blog for a few days, so I thought I’d do a quick post with an overview of what I’ve been working on with the game and some other little projects I’ve been tinkering with.
<br><br>With regards to the game, I’ve been debugging and polishing the mechanics that are already in place before moving forward. The majority of my time has been spent on the fishing mechanic. I had an issue where the sprite animation would ‘pop’ my sprite back by a few pixels when the fishing animation began, this was quickly remedied by adjusting the pivot point of the sprite in the relevant frames. I also fixed an issue with the fishing UI box which was occurring when the player was no longer colliding with the fishing platform, instead of disappearing from view, the UI box would display itself with empty fields. This was solved by setting a new bool parameter within the animator and setting it to become true once the player had left the fishing platform.

<br><br>Yesterday I fitted a 3.5” TFT display to my Raspberry Pi 4B. This is eventually going to be used with a power bank and Wi-Fi adapter with packet injection and monitor mode for portable ethical hacking! I’ve included a few screenshots below of the Raspberry Pi 4B and the newly fitted screen. 

<br><br>I also installed Ubuntu onto my Fire HD 10 tablet! I was looking into getting a smaller laptop for practicing programming then I had the idea of running Linux on my tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard instead. Originally, I wanted to uninstall the custom firmware I was running on the Fire tablet and have Ubuntu as the main OS, but after a bit of googling I decided on a different approach. I used Andronix to install the Linux distro, Termux as the Android terminal emulator to interact with the Linux system, and VNC viewer for remote access and control of the Linux environment. It works incredibly well for simple tasks especially as the Fire HD 10 only has 3GB of RAM.

           <h2>Snow! - 06/05/2023</h2>
<p>Just a quick post about the game today. I started editing my terrain tiles and trees to make a snowy area in the game, which was super quick and simple, yet effective. I also created an empty canvas in Aseprite, dotted around some faint white pixels, created a new frame, then flipped the pixels vertically on the second frame to make a quick snowfall animation. I also fixed a bug that caused the player to drift if an NPC collided with him.

           <h2>Wizard House Update - 05/05/2023</h2>
<p>Last night I spent a bit of time working on a few sprites for the wizard’s house. It only took around 45mins to make some basic pieces of furniture and items to go with them. I didn’t do a lot of shading on the sprites, as I don’t feel that the furniture items need too much work done to them, seeing as they are not the main focus of the scene. I may return to them and improve or replace them if I feel the need, but for now, they are helping me to get a feel for how I’d like the game to look further down the line. 
<br><br>A lot of the game mechanics are in place now so I’m starting to think about creating some levels and storyline. I haven’t decided whether to design the fighting mechanic and animations for the game now, or to keep the player passive and do some level design and story and implement the fighting mechanic and enemies after.

           <h2>Anbernic RG350M Custom Firmware - 03/05/2023</h2>
<p>Today I installed a custom firmware on my Anbernic RG350M handheld retro emulation console. The stock firmware is shockingly bad, so I set about finding custom firmware (CFW) online. There were a few different options available, but I went with ADAM image as it runs OpenDingux beta firmware with RetroArch. I am somewhat familiar with the latter as on a previous project I installed RetroPie on my Raspberry Pi 4 and RetroArch is the emulator for RetroPie.<br><br>
For the installation of the CFW, I formatted both micro-SD cards, then used a program called balenaEtcher to write the firmware image to the first SD card, once finished, I transferred all my ROMs (game files) from my computer into their relevant folders on the second SD card. Finally, once the firmware and ROMs had successfully been transferred, I used a program called Skraper to scrape (locate and download) the box art for the ROMs and then I was done! <br><br>
I’ve attached two screenshots, the first showing the stock firmware, and the second the newly installed CFW. It’s clear to see the CFW is far superior with a beautiful, bright, GUI that is a pleasure to use. A far cry from the dated and disorganized stock firmware it was replacing. In total it took around 90 minutes to complete the installation, this included 45 minutes for the box art scraping. A small amount of time to invest for such a great reward. Right, I'm off to play some Zelda!

<p>Yesterday I started work on a fishing mechanic for the game. I decided (for now, at least) fishing would be triggered when the player stepped onto a fishing platform, the rod would appear, then a random amount of time would pass, the animator would then play a catching fish animation, and finally a UI box would be displayed with the species and weight of the fish caught. I set myself the goal of coding the fishing mechanic myself which I did! It was once I got to the UI system that I started to struggle, and I did get stuck for a very long time. I had an issue trying to get the UI box to appear and disappear when the fish had been caught. I also struggled to get the fishing sequence to start over once a fish had been caught. I used ChatGPT to help with some code and left myself lots of notes for future reference. I’m going to move onto the interior of the wizard’s house for now, but I may return to fishing to make it more interactive in future.

           <h2>Animator Transitions - 29/04/2023</h2>
<p>I’ve just finished editing, animating, and importing the female sprite into the game. I thought I’d do a quick post on animation transitions. Transitions between animated states are set to occur when certain conditions are met. Below I’ve attached a screenshot of the animator transition window. The arrows represent the transitions, and the labelled boxes (nodes) represent the animation for that state. The player or NPC can walk or stand idle in 4 different directions in my game so there are lot’s of transitions for what seems like a small number of movements. That being said, transitions look harder than they are, once the script has the correct variables set for the transition conditions, its just a case of selecting and correctly setting the conditions for each event.

           <h2>Dialogue System – 28/04/2023</h2>
<p>Today I followed the dialogue tutorial on YouTube, and I now have a fantastic, fully functioning, dialogue system! When the player approaches an NPC who he is able to initiate a conversation with, he can press button 1 when in range to trigger the dialogue system, the dialogue box appears with the NPCs name and the text is written character-by-character until all the sentences in the queue have been read, then the dialogue box disappears and the game resumes. This system was too advanced for me to have written by myself so following a tutorial was an excellent way to learn. I always leave lots of notes in my code and save all tutorial videos to a YouTube playlist in case I need to refer back to them at a later date or for another project.

           <h2>Scene Transitions - 27/04/2023</h2>
<p>Today I set to work on the scene transition from the test area, into the house, and back out to the test area. I’ve done scene transitions before 
  but not for entering/exiting buildings. I created an empty game object in my scene, added box collider 2D, and set it as a trigger. I then 
  positioned the collider over the interior door of the house, in my player script I had already setup the collision detection for the exterior door, 
  so I added a short bit code to this so it could detect if the player had collided with the interior door. Then, in a scene management script I set
  the scene to change back to the test area when the player collides with the interior door. This worked fine but I found the instant scene change to 
  be harsh when playing the game. I had no idea how to delay the scene change so asked ChatGPT for help, it suggested creating a method for each scene
  change and invoking the method with a float parameter for the time delay which worked perfectly! Next, I need to make sure the player is in the 
  correct position once he returns to the test area. Then, I can move onto the dialogue system tutorial.

           <h2>Digispark ATTiny85 Rubber Ducky - 26/04/2023</h2>
   <p> A few days ago, I found my Digispark ATTiny85 microcontroller in the back of one of my desk drawers. I purchased it after visiting a forum 
    discussion on ‘bad USBs’ where one of the posters said you could pick one up on Amazon for around £3! What is it? The Digispark ATTiny85 is a 
    small, exposed board microcontroller with a built-in USB connector meaning it can be programmed directly from a computer. 
    <br><br>
    So, this morning I thought I’d finally get round to making my Rubber Ducky. Following along with a tutorial I installed the Arduino IDE and 
    relevant drivers, found a Wi-Fi password stealer GitHub repo for the code, and used webhook.site for a temporary URL to receive the webhook 
    data (in this case: Wi-Fi password). All-in-all it took around half an hour for the rubber ducky to be complete and functioning flawlessly. 
    Rubber ducky’s are designed to look like regular USBs. However, instead of storing data, they contain a small computer which emulates a keyboard
    when plugged into the target device, the computer assumes all is well as it is used to receiving information from the user via the keyboard. 
    Once plugged in, the malicious script will be executed to access and send the targeted sensitive data to the hacker.  
<br><br>
    Hacking projects mentioned on my blog will never be used maliciously, I test them on my own devices and networks only.

        <h2>Game in Unity - 25/04/2023</h2>
          <p>Quick post with a screenshot of the game in Unity in its current state. Everything is as it was before the scene corruption. I’ll be implementing the dialogue system over the next few days. Then, I’ll be designing the interior of the house and setting up a scene transition so when the player enters the house, the test area disappears, and the house interior is shown.

        <h2>Website Relocation - 25/04/2023</h2>
          <p>
Originally, I hosted a free WordPress site with 000Webhost and I was going to use that for the blog. But once I had the site setup to my liking and 
            had my first two blog posts, I realised I’d already used around 40% of my 300MB available space. Also, Google Chrome was annoyingly 
            flagging the blog page as a potentially dangerous site.  
            <br><br> So, I began looking around for free alternatives but, I didn’t really find 
            anything worthwhile. Later that day I happened to be on someone else’s blog reading an ATtiny85 rubber ducky tutorial (which I’ll be 
            starting soon) and wondered how they were hosting their site. I had a look around the site and found they were using GitHub Pages, so 
            I went over to YouTube and searched for a GitHub Pages free website tutorial and began building my page. I downloaded my original site 
            via FTP using filezilla, I thought it would be worth trying to transfer the website files to my new GitHub page. I wasn’t overly 
            optimistic as my original site was using the WordPress content management system and my GitHub Page wasn't - long story short, it 
            didn’t work. So, I started setting up the new page using HTML with ChatGPT there to help when I needed it, and here we are! GitHub 
            Pages has 1GB of available free space which should keep the blog going for a while, if I get close to exceeding that, I can consider 
            my options as to what I'll do next, but for now I’ll be keeping the blog here.

    <h2>Unknown Error - 25/04/2023</h2>
    <p>
So, ironically after I wrote the last post regarding the current state of the game, I opened up Unity to take some screenshots for the blog and was 
      greeted with a red error message stating there was an unknown error while loading my scene! After a quick google and a conversation with 
      ChatGPT I had a few potential fixes to try out in an attempt save many hours of work. I tried: re-importing the scene, deleting scene metadata,
      editing the unity scene file, copying the entire project folder and re-importing... all to no avail. I did have a backup, but it was 9 
      days old, so it wasn't of much use. Needless to say, I'll be far more vigilant with my backups going forward. Fortunately, it was only my 
      scene that was corrupted, and my assets and scripts were still present. So, I set about painting a new test area from the tile palette and 
      configuring my various assets with the correct scripts and settings. I tried to remind myself that though annoying, it was probably a good 
      opportunity to reinforce what I'd learnt, and the game is now back to its previous state.

        <h2>Current State of the Game - 24/04/2023</h2>
        <p>In this post I thought I'd discuss the game in its current state, what I'm working on now, and what's next.
          <br><br>
          Currently the game has a small test area with trees, water, and a house. There is a playable character who is fully animated and can be controlled by the user. There is also a fully animated NPC wizard who patrols the test area randomly and has a single line of dialogue if the user interacts with him. The house has an animated door that opens when the player is in range and the player sprite has a fade animation to make it appear that the player has entered the building. 
          For the input controls I've modified a touch screen thumbstick asset to make it function as a D-Pad on the left side of the screen and I have an action button on the right side of the screen which for now is being used to interact with the NPC and trigger dialogue.
          <br><br>
          At the moment I'm working on implementing a dialogue mechanic into the game. I attempted to do this myself and managed to trigger a dialogue box and text to be displayed when the player interacts with the NPC, but this wouldn't work for multiple lines of dialogue with multiple characters. So, I'm going to be following a far more advanced YouTube tutorial which is more fit for purpose. 
          <br><br>
          As for the future of the game and what I'd like to achieve, I'd like to create a functioning game with a basic storyline, multiple levels, more characters, weapons, and enemies. I think this is a reasonable and achievable goal. As I said in my previous post, this game is personal project to become more proficient at programming and game design, therefore I may decide to leave this project unfinished to move onto something I believe to be more productive.
          <br><br>

          <h2 id="april-2023">Hello World! - 23/04/2023</h2>
        <p>In my first post I wanted to outline my intentions with the blog and discuss my current project. 
My aim is to collate my work into an accessible portfolio-style journal that could be presented 
to potential employers and to keep track of my progress for personal development. Prior to starting 
this blog my personal projects have gone undocumented and in some cases forgotten.
<br><br>
For my current project I am developing a 2D top-down RPG game for Android using Unity game engine 
for the game development and Aseprite for the sprite and asset design. I always attempt to write as 
much of the code as I can myself but when I need help I've been using a combination of: YouTube tutorials, 
google, and ChatGPT. I want to be completely forthcoming that the code in the game is an amalgamation of my code, 
tutorials, and ChatGPT. The game is a personal learning project to further my understanding of programming and 
game development and I currently have no intentions of releasing it on the Play Store. 
<br><br>
I hope to upload some screenshots of the game later today and keep the blog updated as often as I can. 
Ideally I'd like to update the blog each time I work on the game, but due to family commitments and uni 
this is near impossible, so I may do a bulk update with multiple posts to keep the blog up-to-date.
<br><br>
