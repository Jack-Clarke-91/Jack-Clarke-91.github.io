        <h2>Blog Post Title 3</h2>
        <p>24/04/2023
          In my first post I wanted to outline my intentions with the blog and discuss my current project. 
My aim is to collate my work into an accessible portfolio-style journal that could be presented 
to potential employers and to keep track of my progress for personal development. Prior to starting 
this blog my personal projects have gone undocumented and in some cases forgotten.

For my current project I am developing a 2D top-down RPG game for Android using Unity game engine 
for the game development and Aseprite for the sprite and asset design. I always attempt to write as 
much of the code as I can myself but when I need help I've been using a combination of: YouTube tutorials, 
google, and ChatGPT. I want to be completely forthcoming that the code in the game is an amalgamation of my code, 
tutorials, and ChatGPT. The game is a personal learning project to further my understanding of programming and 
game development and I currently have no intentions of releasing it on the Play Store. 

I hope to upload some screenshots of the game later today and keep the blog updated as often as I can. 
Ideally I'd like to update the blog each time I work on the game, but due to family commitments and uni 
this is near impossible, so I may do a bulk update with multiple posts to keep the blog up-to-date.

Thanks for reading,

Jack</p>
