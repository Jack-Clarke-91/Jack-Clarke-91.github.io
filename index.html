        <h2>Game in Unity - 25/04/2023</h2>
          <p>Quick post with a screenshot of the game in Unity in its current state. Everything is as it was before the scene corruption. I’ll be implementing the dialogue system over the next few days. Then, I’ll be designing the interior of the house and setting up a scene transition so when the player enters the house, the test area disappears, and the house interior is shown.

        <h2>Website Relocation - 25/04/2023</h2>
          <p>
Originally, I hosted a free WordPress site with 000Webhost and I was going to use that for the blog. But once I had the site setup to my liking and had my first two blog posts, I realised I’d already used around 40% of my 300MB available space. Also, Google Chrome was annoyingly flagging the blog page as a potentially dangerous site.  So, I began looking around for free alternatives but, I didn’t really find anything worthwhile. Later that day I happened to be on someone else’s blog reading an ATtiny85 rubber ducky tutorial (which I’ll be starting soon) and wondered how they were hosting their site. I had a look around the site and found they were using GitHub Pages, so I went over to YouTube and searched for a GitHub Pages free website tutorial and began building my page. I downloaded my original site via FTP using filezilla, I thought it would be worth trying to transfer the website files to my new GitHub page, though wasn’t overly optimistic due to the WordPress content management - long story short, it didn’t work. So, I started setting up the new page using HTML with ChatGPT there for help when I needed it, and here we are! GitHub Pages has 1GB of available space for free which should keep the blog going for a while, if I get close to exceeding that I can consider my options as to what to do next, but for now I’ll be keeping my blog here for the foreseeable future.

    <h2>Unknown Error - 25/04/2023</h2>
    <p>
So, ironically after I wrote the last post regarding the current state of the game, I opened up unity to take some screen shots for the blog and was greeted with a red error message stating there was an unknown error while loading my scene! After a quick google and a conversation with ChatGPT I had a few potential fixes to try out in an attempt save many hours of work. I tried: re-importing the scene, deleting scene meta data, editing the unity scene file, copying the entire project folder and re-importing... all to no avail. I did have a backup, but it was 9 days old, so it wasn't of much use. Needless to say, I'll be far more vigilant with my backups going forward. Fortunately, it was only my scene that was corrupted, and my assets and scripts were still present. So, I set about painting a new test area from the tile palette and configuring my various assets with the correct scripts and settings. I tried to remind myself that though annoying it was probably and good opportunity to reinforce what I've learnt, and the game is now back to its previous state.

        <h2>Current State of the Game - 24/04/2023</h2>
        <p>In this post I thought I'd discuss the game in its current state, what I'm working on now, and what's next.
          <br><br>
          Currently the game has a small test area with trees, water, and a house. There is a playable character who is fully animated and can be controlled by the user. There is also a fully animated NPC wizard who patrols the test area randomly and has a single line of dialogue if the user interacts with him. The house has an animated door that opens when the player is in range and the player sprite has a fade animation to make it appear that the player has entered the building. 
          For the input controls I've modified a touch screen thumbstick asset to make it function as a D-Pad on the left side of the screen and I have an action button on the right side of the screen which for now is being used to interact with the NPC and trigger dialogue.
          <br><br>
          At the moment I'm working on implementing a dialogue mechanic into the game. I attempted to do this myself and managed to trigger a dialogue box and text to be displayed when the player interacts with the NPC, but this wouldn't work for multiple lines of dialogue with multiple characters. So, I'm going to be following a far more advanced YouTube tutorial which is more fit for purpose. 
          <br><br>
          As for the future of the game and what I'd like to achieve, I'd like to create a functioning game with a basic storyline, multiple levels, more characters, weapons, and enemies. I think this is a reasonable and achievable goal. As I said in my previous post, this game is personal project to become more proficient at programming and game design, therefore I may decide to leave this project unfinished to move onto something I believe to be more productive.
          <br><br>

          <h2>Hello World! - 23/04/2023</h2>
        <p>In my first post I wanted to outline my intentions with the blog and discuss my current project. 
My aim is to collate my work into an accessible portfolio-style journal that could be presented 
to potential employers and to keep track of my progress for personal development. Prior to starting 
this blog my personal projects have gone undocumented and in some cases forgotten.
<br><br>
For my current project I am developing a 2D top-down RPG game for Android using Unity game engine 
for the game development and Aseprite for the sprite and asset design. I always attempt to write as 
much of the code as I can myself but when I need help I've been using a combination of: YouTube tutorials, 
google, and ChatGPT. I want to be completely forthcoming that the code in the game is an amalgamation of my code, 
tutorials, and ChatGPT. The game is a personal learning project to further my understanding of programming and 
game development and I currently have no intentions of releasing it on the Play Store. 
<br><br>
I hope to upload some screenshots of the game later today and keep the blog updated as often as I can. 
Ideally I'd like to update the blog each time I work on the game, but due to family commitments and uni 
this is near impossible, so I may do a bulk update with multiple posts to keep the blog up-to-date.
<br><br>
Thanks for reading,
<br><br>
